The path_idx function takes a path cell, c, and returns its index within the path_cell vector. The is_adjacent_to function, solved_path function,
 print_solved_path function, and is_adjacent_to function all work, to my knowledge.

The program may not work if there are more than two outputs since there are only one start and end variables.
Also, if there is more than one path, the function may only recognize the first one found.

I have been making my project in clion and it currently works in clion.
