To my knowledge, all of my functions should work with the inputs I have tested them with. The path_idx function takes
a path cell, c, and returns its index within the path_cell vector. The is_adjacent_to function, solved_path function,
 print_solved_path function, and is_adjacent_to function all work, to my knowledge.

The program may not work of there are more than two outputs since there are only one start and end variables.
Also, if there is more than one path, the function may only recognize the first one found.

AFTER testing the Makefile in the terminal, I came up with errors reguarding tuples, ./maze.h:18:23: error: no template named 'tuple' in namespace 'std'. 

I have been making my project in clion and it currently works in clion.
